However, under the current system, there exists a huge imbalance for different customers: a great many did not get any recommendations while a small number receive plenty. Our final project aims to solve this problem and predict what products each existing customers would purchase for the next month based on either their own past purchasing behaviors or that of similar customers.

  * Use 1.5 years of customers behavior data provided from Santander bank to predict what a customer will buy in addition to what they already had.
* Technology Used
  * Data visualization, Feature Engineering, Logistic regression, K-means clustering, Collaborative Filtering, Spark, AWS EMR cluster
