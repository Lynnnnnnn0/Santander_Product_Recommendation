Santander Bank provides a great variety of financial products.  However, under the current system, there exists a huge imbalance for different customers: a great many did not get any recommendations while a small number receive plenty. Our final project aims to solve this problem and predict what products each existing customers would purchase for the next month based on either their own past purchasing behaviors or that of similar customers.
